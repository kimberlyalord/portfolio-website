    <div class="about-me">Welcome to my portfolio site! I am a software engineer based in Denver, Colorado. As a typical 90s kid, I learned HTML at a young age to customize my MySpace profile, and I had always enjoyed working on computers, but I never truly entertained the idea of working in IT until I ended up in an IT-adjacent job three years after college. I started cultivating my interest in computing while working in a data integrity role for a year, and decided that I wanted to attend a "coding bootcamp." In April 2020, in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, I started my full-time software engineering immersive course at General Assembly. We were supposed to attend this class in person but the public health crisis forced us to do everything online, but we were able to adjust to the circumstances, learn a ton, and still connect and get valuable experience with teamwork. Now I have graduated from GA and am seeking my first programming job! I'm thankful that my time at GA allowed me to create the projects featured here - if you have any questions for me, please click <a href="mailto:kalord93@gmail.com">here</a> to send me an email!</div>
