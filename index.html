    <div class="about-me">Welcome to my portfolio site! I am a software engineer based in Denver, Colorado. As a typical 90s kid, I learned HTML at a young age to customize my MySpace profile, and I had always enjoyed working on computers, but I never truly entertained the idea of working in IT until I ended up in an IT-adjacent job three years after college. I started cultivating my interest in computing while working in a data integrity role for a year, and decided that I wanted to attend a "coding bootcamp." In April 2020, in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, I started my full-time software engineering immersive course at General Assembly. We were supposed to attend this class in person but the public health crisis forced us to do everything online; however, we were able to adjust to the circumstances, learn a ton, and still connect and get valuable experience with teamwork. Now I have graduated from GA and am seeking my first programming job! I'm thankful that my time at GA allowed me to create the projects featured here - if you have any questions for me, please click <a href="mailto:kalord93@gmail.com">here</a> to send me an email!</div>

      <p>"Memory with Cats" was my first major coding project created while I was at GA. The assignment was to create a browser-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to do something I could put my personality into, and as a lifelong cat lover, I went with this spin-off of the classic game Simon, but with cat tiles instead of the original red, yellow, blue, and green buttons.</p>

      <p>"Cookie Compiler" is my first full-stack web app. Created with Node.js and MongoDB using the Express framework, Cookie Compiler is a recipe app that allows users to create, update, and delete their own cookie recipes, as well as read and leave reviews for any recipe. This was also my first foray into authentication (Google OAuth).</p>
