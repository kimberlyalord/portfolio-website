    <div class="about-me">Welcome to my portfolio site! I am a software engineer based in Denver, Colorado. As a typical '90s kid, I learned HTML at a young age to customize my MySpace profile, but I never truly entertained the idea of working in IT until this year! In April 2020, in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, I started a full-time software engineering immersive course at General Assembly. Three months later, I have graduated from GA and am seeking my first programming job! My time at GA has allowed me to create the projects featured here - if you have any questions for me, please click <a href="mailto:kalord93@gmail.com">here</a> to send me an email!</div>

      <p>"Memory with Cats" was my first major coding project created while I was at GA. The assignment was to create a browser-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to do something I could put my personality into, and as a lifelong cat lover, I went with this spin-off of the classic game Simon, but with cat tiles instead of the original red, yellow, blue, and green buttons.</p>

      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/J6i1d5y.png" alt="screenshot">
      <p>"Cookie Compiler" is my first full-stack web app. Created with Node.js and MongoDB using the Express framework, Cookie Compiler is a recipe app that allows users to create, update, and delete their own cookie recipes, as well as read and leave reviews for any recipe. This was also my first foray into authentication (Google OAuth).</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3LNU1Xf.png" alt="screenshot">
      <p>"Chinchilla Collector" was created using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The app allows a user to create a collection of virtual chinchillas, update or delete them, add feedings and baths to a chinchilla, and add and remove toys.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/baBKk86.png" alt="screenshot">
      <p>"GASapp" was a group project with fellow GA alums <a href="https://traviscashion.com/">Travis Cashion</a> and <a href="http://github.com/chris-violante">Chris Violante</a>. The app was created using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it consumes the third-party API offered by <a href="https://www.reverb-api.com/">Reverb.com</a>. GASapp is designed to be a singular, intuitive site for musicians who suffer from "Gear Acquistion Syndrome" to keep track of and valuate their music gear, and also to maintain a wishlist and connect them with links to online listings for gear they don't own <i>yet</i>.</p>

      <p>"Learmember" is a portmanteau of "learn" and "remember." This full-stack app is designed to be  a place where you can keep track of things that you want to learn. Users can add, update, and delete learning topics, associate learning resources with their topics, and filter lists by whether they have already learned the topic or not. Learmember was created as a single-page application using React, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.</p>
